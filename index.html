      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p class="aboutme">
        Although I have a deep love and appreciation for web development, I wasn't always planning on becoming a software engineer. I began my professional career as a high school mathematics teacher. During my experience, I found myself frequently gravitiating towards the use of technology. I used programming languages to create math worksheets and assessments, learning more and more about the intricacies of coding. Through this, I discovered a hidden passion. After three years of working in the education system, I decided to take on a challenge, and pursue a different path.</p>
        
      <p class="aboutme">I am currently a student at Thinkful, building my career as a software developer. It has been an incredible journey so far, and I cannot wait to see what lies ahead. I am deeply looking forward to working with other professionals and building a network of people who share the same enthusiasm and dedication for building software. Please contact me if you are interested in working together or if you have any questions. The links to my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn can be found at the bottom of the page. </p>
        
      <p class="aboutme">Outside of web development, I enjoy:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Spending time with friends and family- I have two beautiful, little nieces and an adorable new nephew.</li>
          <li>Travelling- I'm always planning a trip or visiting somewhere I haven't been before. From road trips to campouts, I love an adventure.</li>
