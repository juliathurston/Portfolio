## HTML validators
An HTML validator is a quality-assurance tool that can detect common syntax errors such as extra spaces, open tags, or missing quotation marks. These syntax errors could cause a page to render correctly in one browser but not in another. You can use an HTML validator to automatically verify your HTML page for syntax errors. You can then correct any coding mistakes identified by the validator program.

There are many web-based HTML validator programs available for free. One example is the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).


This service offers various ways to validate a document: you can provide the URI where your document is hosted, upload a file, or directly paste the HTML input into the provided text area.

Before submitting, make sure to validate your HTML file using an HTML validator. Then address any issues identified by the validator to the best of your ability.
